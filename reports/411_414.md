# Aim

To compare throughput of Kernel 4.11 (2017Q3 Armbian mainline) and Kernel 4.14 (2018Q2 Armbian "next") images

See the [reference](reference.md) for info on test methodology and advice when reading the graphs.

# Summary

There is no clear improvement or regression between the two images, both devices can service 10-11 simulateous 480p clients.

# Background

The two devices, Pilot1 and Pilot2 are 25-unit pilot devices (256mb NEO + HAT + unbranded RT5372).

Pilot1 is running a [20180122 image](https://github.com/ConnectBox/connectbox-pi/releases/tag/v20180122) which has a 4.11 kernel.

Pilot2 is running a [20180418 image](https://github.com/ConnectBox/connectbox-pi/releases/tag/v20180418) which has a 4.14 kernel.

For these tests the ConnectBox devices were placed at a distance of 20ft from the clients, with a clear line-of-site. The ConnectBox devices were 3ft off the ground, on a wooden shelf.

# Test Results

Each client is attempting to stream at 480p.
