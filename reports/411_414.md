# Aim

To see if there is a regression in throughput in moving from Kernel 4.11/2017Q3 Armbian mainline to Kernel 4.14/2018Q2 Armbian "next".

See the [reference](reference.md) for info on test methodology and advice when reading the graphs.

# Summary

There is no regression in moving to kernel 4.14/2018Q2 Armbian "next". There may be a marginal improvement.

# Background

The two devices, Pilot1 and Pilot2 are 25-unit pilot devices (256mb NEO + HAT + unbranded RT5372).

Pilot1 is running a [20180122 image](https://github.com/ConnectBox/connectbox-pi/releases/tag/v20180122) which has a 4.11 kernel.

Pilot2 is running a [20180418 image](https://github.com/ConnectBox/connectbox-pi/releases/tag/v20180418) which has a 4.14 kernel.

For these tests the ConnectBox devices were placed at a distance of 20ft from the clients, with a clear line-of-site. The ConnectBox devices were 3ft off the ground, on a wooden shelf.

# Test Results

Each client is attempting to stream at 480p.

## 10 Clients

No performance regression going from 4.11 to 4.14. 4.14 may be a slight improvement.
