## Variance on the same device

Two identical tests, made within a few hours of each other, on the same hardware, with the same clients

Early Test (full throughput for all clients for the entirety of the test)

![p2-9c9s-early]

Late Test (full throughput for most clients, with some underperformers, and drop-off in throughput part-way through the test)
